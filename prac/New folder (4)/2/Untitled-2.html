    <h1>Apple Inc.</h1>
    <blockquote>Apple's first product, the Apple I,
         invented by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,
          was sold as an assembled circuit board and 
          lacked basic features such as a keyboard, 
          monitor, and case. The owner of this unit
           added a keyboard and wooden case.</blockquote>
